# WAR-Model
This R project aimed to predict Wins Above Replacement (WAR) using a KNN model, and calculating accuracy using mean absolute error.

Successes:
- KNN Model capable of predicting WAR with a mean absolute error of 0.351.
- Learned more about the 'baseballr' package which is useful for quickly scraping baseball statistics.

To Do:
- Update this project with more statistical models to compare which type of model is able to predict WAR best.
